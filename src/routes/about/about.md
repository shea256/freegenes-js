FreeGenes is an open registry for genetic parts and a framework for bioengineering.

You can browse the genetic parts on FreeGenes, order genetic part collections, and request that new genes be added to the registry.

Just like the iGEM Parts Registry, the FreeGenes registry makes it easier to engineer organisms through broader availability of genetic parts.

And just like Biobricks, the Freegenes framework simplifies genome building through careful design of the parts available so they can be readily combined with minimal effort.

FreeGenes is different from iGEM in that it further broadens access. While iGEM is difficult for academic institutions and companies to use because it does not include material transfer agreements, FreeGenes provides unambiguous sharing through the Open Material Transfer Agreement (OpenMTA). While iGEM keeps a centralized network that distributes DNA once a year, FreeGenes is designed to continuously distribute DNA globally through a decentralized network of distribution nodes.

FreeGenes is different from the Biobricks framework in its increased efficiency and versatility. While Biobricks only allows you to combine two genetic parts at a time, FreeGenes enables you to combine 10-25 different genetic parts in a single step.

### Request for Help

We need your help. Tell us what useful DNA sequences should be developed for an open biotechnology commons and we will make them for you! What's the catch? Materials will be made available for you and others under the OpenMTA so everyone can develop applications that benefit all people and the planet.

### What Happens Next

We will make these genes for free for you and everyone else. We will also make sure that the genes are readily available and check that they are not covered by sequence-specific patent claims. Stated differently, when we say free we mean both "NO COST" AND "FREEDOM". It's kind of like having free beer AND freedom of speech. Hooray!

### How It Works

1. **Sequence Preparation** - We will compile your sequences and make any necessary changes to the DNA for compatibility with our high-throughput cloning process.
2. **Cursory Review** - Your sequences will be checked for biosecurity, suitability for synthesis, and other features.
3. **Public Comment** - Once enough genes have been compiled for an order, we will create a public post where you can see any changes made to your sequences and request modifications.
4. **Public Distribution** - After the cloning process is complete, we will again post the sequences publicly and distribute your DNA to you.

### What You Can Expect

1. We hold all sequences until there are enough for a batch order from Twist Bioscience.
2. Synthesis via Twist Bioscience now takes ~3-4 weeks to complete, depending on sequence complexity.
3. Once we receive the newly synthesized DNA, it is processed in one of two ways: A. If you have requested DNA that can be made into MoClo-compatible parts, we will clone and sequence verify the DNA before shipping clonal plasmid stock to you. B. If you have requested DNA that cannot be made MoClo-compatible, we will ship an aliquot of the raw synthesized DNA, keeping other aliquots for any other people interested.
4. The process of cloning and validation takes an additional ~2 weeks.
5. The Free Genes Project is still in beta, so please work with us to make this an efficient and productive community effort.
6. We are synthesizing, cloning, sequencing, and freely distributing 10,000 genes via the bionet.io project and under the Open Material Transfer Agreement (OpenMTA)
