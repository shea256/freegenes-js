FreeGenes is a DNA commons. Everyone is free to browse the collection of genes, order genes from the collection, and request that new genes to be added to the collection.

### Request for Help

We need your help. Tell us what useful DNA sequences should be developed for an open biotechnology commons and we will make them for you! What's the catch? Materials will be made available for you and others under the OpenMTA so everyone can develop applications that benefit all people and the planet.

### What Happens Next

We will make these genes for free for you and everyone else. We will also make sure that the genes are readily available and check that they are not covered by sequence-specific patent claims. Stated differently, when we say free we mean both "NO COST" AND "FREEDOM". It's kind of like having free beer AND freedom of speech. Hooray!

### How It Works

1. **Sequence Preparation** - We will compile your sequences and make any necessary changes to the DNA for compatibility with our high-throughput cloning process.
2. **Cursory Review** - Your sequences will be checked for biosecurity, suitability for synthesis, and other features.
3. **Public Comment** - Once enough genes have been compiled for an order, we will create a public post where you can see any changes made to your sequences and request modifications.
4. **Public Distribution** - After the cloning process is complete, we will again post the sequences publicly and distribute your DNA to you.

### What You Can Expect

1. We hold all sequences until there are enough for a batch order from Twist Bioscience.
2. Synthesis via Twist Bioscience now takes ~3-4 weeks to complete, depending on sequence complexity.
3. Once we receive the newly synthesized DNA, it is processed in one of two ways: A. If you have requested DNA that can be made into MoClo-compatible parts, we will clone and sequence verify the DNA before shipping clonal plasmid stock to you. B. If you have requested DNA that cannot be made MoClo-compatible, we will ship an aliquot of the raw synthesized DNA, keeping other aliquots for any other people interested.
4. The process of cloning and validation takes an additional ~2 weeks.
5. The Free Genes Project is still in beta, so please work with us to make this an efficient and productive community effort.
6. We are synthesizing, cloning, sequencing, and freely distributing 10,000 genes via the bionet.io project and under the Open Material Transfer Agreement (OpenMTA)
